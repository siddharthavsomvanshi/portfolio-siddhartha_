<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Siddhartha Vardhan Somvanshi, a passionate learner and aspiring Full Stack Developer from Gonda, Uttar Pradesh.

I’m currently pursuing my studies at KIET Group of Institutions, where I’m building a strong foundation in programming, web development, and modern technologies. My goal is to become a versatile developer capable of creating efficient, user-friendly, and impactful web applications.

I enjoy learning new tools and frameworks, experimenting with creative ideas, and solving real-world problems through technology. I believe in continuous learning and hands-on practice — qualities that drive me to improve every day.

When I’m not coding, I love exploring tech innovations, reading about historical figures, and gaining inspiration from India’s rich heritage.</p>
